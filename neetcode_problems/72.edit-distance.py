# Testcase Example:  '"horse"\n"ros"'
#
# Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations
# required to convert word1 to word2.
# 
# You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
# 
# 
# Insert a character
# Delete a character
# Replace a character
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 
# horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
# rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
# rose -> ros (remove 'e')
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: 
# intention -> inention (remove 't')
# inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
# enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
# exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
# exection -> execution (insert 'u')
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
# word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.
# 
# 
#
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
