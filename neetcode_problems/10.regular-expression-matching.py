# Testcase Example:  '"aa"\n"a"'
#
# Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression
# matching with support for '.' and '*' where:
# 
# 
# '.' Matches any single character.​​​​
# '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
# 
# 
# The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
# Output: false
# Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
# Output: true
# Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore,
# by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
# Output: true
# Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length <= 20
# 1 <= p.length <= 20
# s contains only lowercase English letters.
# p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.
# It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character '*', there will be a
# previous valid character to match.
# 
#
