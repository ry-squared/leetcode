#
# Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and
# ']', determine if the input string is valid.
# 
# An input string is valid if:
# 
# 
# Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
# Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
# Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "()"
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "()[]{}"
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "(]"
# Output: false
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
# s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.
# 
# 
#

    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
