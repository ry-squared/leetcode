#
# Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is
# a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and
# false otherwise.
# 
# A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and
# all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a
# subtree of itself.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
# Output: false
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the root tree is in the range [1, 2000].
# The number of nodes in the subRoot tree is in the range [1, 1000].
# -10^4 <= root.val <= 10^4
# -10^4 <= subRoot.val <= 10^4
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSubtree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], subRoot: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
